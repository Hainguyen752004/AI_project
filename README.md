# AI_project

**Getting Started:**

This project requires basic knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with computer vision libraries. 

**Dependencies (may vary):**

* Python
* OpenCV (computer vision library)
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (AI frameworks)
* Specific AI models depending on your chosen application

**Instructions (general outline):**

1. **Set up your environment:** Install necessary libraries.
2. **Choose an AI model:** Select a pre-trained model or train your own model for your desired application.
3. **Develop your code:** Write Python code to capture frames, process them with the AI model, and interpret the results.
4. **Test and refine:** Test your code with various scenarios and refine the model or processing steps as needed.
